# Global Economic Indicators

## Overview
For our first independent project we were tasked with using our SQL and Excel knowledge to select, explore, and visualize storytelling-worthy data. We were given the option to choose from three distinct data sources and I chose to work on the ['World Development Indicators' dataset. ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mariapushkareva/world-development-indicators-with-sql/)

## About the Dataset
The World Development Indicators dataset contains more than 1,000 indicators of development for about 250 countries worldwide. The data was first collected in 1960, however, not all countries have all indicators for all years. *(For a summary of all the indicators, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16oxJIe9QgBsi9bTTqLtgHcTMdA_cxPg_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117675393614077190328&rtpof=true&sd=true))*
